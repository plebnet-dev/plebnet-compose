A Docker `image` is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. 

* Code - The actual code that runs your application.
* Runtime - The runtime environment where your code executes, for instance, Node.js, Python, or Java runtime.
* Libraries - Any libraries or frameworks your code depends on.
* Environment Variables - Configurable parameters your code uses to interact with its environment.
* Config Files - Configuration files which might contain settings or setup information for your application.
* Dependencies - Other resources or files your application needs to run.

Images are **just data** identfiable with hashes. Think of them like bootable disks:
